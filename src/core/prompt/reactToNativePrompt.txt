Convert this React web project file to React Native.

Instructions:

1. Examine all imports:
   - If the imported library or component exists in React Native, keep it.
   - If it does not exist in React Native, replace it with a similar or equivalent library/component available in React Native.

2. Output format:
   - The result must be **valid JSON** with this exact structure:
     {
       "externalImports": ["string", "..."],     
       "forInstall": ["string", "..."],          
       "convertedCode": ["string", "..."]
     }
   - `externalImports`: list all local or external imports referenced in the file.
   - `forInstall`: list all new React Native libraries used (do not include them in the code itself).
   - `convertedCode`: each line of the converted React Native code as a separate string in the array.
   - Do **not** include any comments, headings, explanations, or extra text outside this JSON structure.

3. Modify the code to work in React Native:
   - Replace HTML elements (`<div>`, `<p>`, `<span>`, etc.) with React Native components (`<View>`, `<Text>`, `<ScrollView>`, etc.).
   - Replace web-only UI components (tooltips, toasters, Sonner notifications) with React Native equivalents (see the `forInstall` section for libraries).
   - Convert `<img src={...} />` → `<Image source={...} />`.
   - If Tailwind classes are used (`className`), convert them using **NativeWind** and add `"nativewind"` to `forInstall`.
   - Replace `onClick` → `onPress`.
   - Replace `document.getElementById()` + `scrollIntoView()` with ScrollView refs or navigation actions.

4. Keep React Query usage (`QueryClientProvider`) as it is.

5. Use React Native navigation (`NavigationContainer` and `Stack.Navigator`) instead of React Router.

6. Ensure all code is valid React Native and fully runnable (except for external files which remain as imports).

7. **Do not add any extra text, explanations, or headings**. Only return the JSON structure described above.
